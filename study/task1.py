# Dot-decimal notation represents a list of integers as a string. The
# integers are written in base 10 (decimal), separated by periods:
#
# '22.4.5'
#
# Given a dot-decimal string containing 0 or more integers, return the
# corresponding list of integers:
#
# '22.4.5' => [22, 4, 5]

# Write a unit test for the example above before you write your code.
